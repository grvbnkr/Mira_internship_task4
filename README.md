# Mira_internship_task4

A Python Tkinter project of a student management system with ID, name, and marks using SQLite3 for the database and including all validation and CRUD operations and a chart showing the marking of students in ascending order can be designed as follows:

GUI design

The GUI of the app can be designed with the following components:

A label for the title of the app
A text box for the user to enter the student ID
A text box for the user to enter the student name
A text box for the user to enter the student marks
A button to add a new student entry
A button to update an existing student entry
A button to delete a student entry
A button to search for a student entry
A Scrolledtext to display the student records
A button to generate a chart showing the marking of students in ascending order
Validation

The app will use the following validation to ensure that the user enters valid data:

The student ID text box must not be empty.
The student ID must be unique.
The student name text box must not be empty.
The student marks text box must not be empty.
The student marks must be a number between 0 and 100.
CRUD operations

The app will use the following CRUD operations to perform operations on the database of students:

Create: To add a new student entry to the database.
Read: To retrieve student records from the database.
Update: To update an existing student entry in the database.
Delete: To delete a student entry from the database.
Chart generation

The app will use a library such as Matplotlib to generate a chart showing the marking of students in ascending order. The chart can be a bar chart or a line chart.

How the app will work

The app will work as follows:

The user enters the student ID, name, and marks in the respective text boxes.
The user clicks the add button to add a new student entry.
The app validates the student ID, name, and marks.
If the validation is successful, the app inserts a new row into the database with the student ID, name, and marks.
The app displays a message to the user indicating that the student entry has been added successfully.
To update an existing student entry, the user enters the student ID and name of the student whose entry they want to update.
The user clicks the update button.
The app retrieves the student record from the database.
The app displays a dialog box for the user to update the student record.
The user updates the student record and clicks the ok button.
The app validates the updated student record.
If the validation is successful, the app updates the student record in the database.
The app displays a message to the user indicating that the student entry has been updated successfully.
To delete a student entry, the user enters the student ID of the student whose entry they want to delete.
The user clicks the delete button.
The app retrieves the student record from the database.
The app displays a message to the user confirming that they want to delete the student entry.
If the user clicks the yes button, the app deletes the student entry from the database.
The app displays a message to the user indicating that the student entry has been deleted successfully.
To see the student data view button is needed to click it shows all entrys of student in scrolledtext
To generate a chart showing the marking of students in ascending order, the user clicks the generate chart button.
The app uses the Matplotlib library to generate a bar chart showing the marking of students in ascending order.
The app displays the chart in a new window.
This is just a brief description of how a Python Tkinter project of a student management system with ID, name, and marks using SQLite3 for the database and including all validation and CRUD operations and a chart showing the marking of students in ascending order can be designed.
